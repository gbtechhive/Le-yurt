            <h2>Cultural Experience</h2>
            <p>Some experiences in life become astronomical, especially those earned by traveling. When you visit us, we
                want you to have to interact with the locals, learn about their clothing style, learn how they live and
                experience authentic living like a local, and permeate your soul. In the same manner, it also influences
                their views, their values, their humor, their hopes, their loyalties, and their worries and fears. So,
                working with people and building relationships with them helps you have some perspective and
                understanding of their cultures.</p>

                    <p>Gilgit Baltistan, a mountainous region in the northern part of Pakistan and one of the most
                        exotic places in Pakistan, was a complete package of adventures and happenings. Dwelling in
                        an artistically designed wooden frame bounded by the countless species of flora and fauna, a
                        never-ending green slope declining from the horizon, and a synchronized chirping of birds
                        creating music of nature – all combined form a blessed event that everyone dreamt of.
                        Moreover, this scenic view is further endorsed by the interior layout of the yurt, which is
                        organized entirely by the ecological amenities. Mini library facing the bed stranded by a
                        group of money plants and two large windows to feel the breathtaking events of dusk and
                        dawn. </p>

                            Shalwar, with the long kameez touching the knees with different shades and colors, is
                            prominent among the men. At the same time, the classic cap is the most stylish component of
                            women's clothing. Different kinds of caps are adopted, but the lovely embroidered Iraghi cap
                            with the customary piece of jewelry known as Silsila is the most popular hat.
                            Most interestingly, male members of the society wear different kinds of woolen caps, which
                            play a vibrant role in defining the identity of the people of Gilgit Baltistan. Hat for men
                            is available in a range of earthy hues, including brown, black, grey, and ivory. The
                            traditional hat looks like a bag with a flat, circular bottom before it is fitted and worn.
                            The wearer forms a thick band by rolling up the sides almost all the way to the top, which
                            is then placed on the head to resemble a beret or hat. </p>
