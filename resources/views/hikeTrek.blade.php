        <h2>Hike And Trek</h2>
        <p>No matter where you look, you will always find beauty around you. And there is no better artist than Mother
            Nature with some of the best works of art being seen in mountains, ranges, and hills. And Gilgit Baltistan
            has been blessed as far as breathtaking views and interesting natural features go. Just look at the
            mountains located at the heart of every Valley in Gilgit Baltistan, and you will see what we mean. From a
            distance, with hands and feet. It is for this reason that Le Yurt gives you an opportunity to explore
            through Hikes and Treks.</p>

                <p>Start your hike from the interspersed camphor bushes with their soothing minty aroma to get you skyed
                    and ready to go. The meandering trail gives you a perfect hug of the hill, gaining great height and
                    altitude and coming on top of the mighty mountain’s head. Once here, take a moment to catch your
                    breath before making your way further uphill to end up on the ‘nose’ which is also the highest point
                    of the hill. Take a moment to soak up the breathtaking panoramic views. To the North is Lake and a
                    lush green fields, to the South you will see a blue sky with some dense clouds, to the East there is
                    a blanket of snow Hills and to the West are the ever-green small valleys with cloudy sky.</p>

        <p>Besides majestic mountains, green meadows, wildlife, gushing rivers, and pristine lakes there is a lot more
            to Gilgit Baltistan than just travel warnings. Picturesque views, natural landscapes, and some of the most
            unique lakes and mountains are what make Gilgit Baltistan one of the coolest places to visit.</p>

                <p>It is home to around 108 mountain peaks that are above 7000 meters. That is why we have some of the
                    best hiking trails in the world. While it doesn’t take a lot of effort to view the beauty of these
                    sky-scraping peaks from a distance, discovering the secrets of these natural wonders, in person,
                    requires a lot of hard work. For example, once you get off the Karakoram Highway, you can see the
                    mountains are quite nearby. That said, the sights that you’re blessed with along the way turn it
                    into an experience of a lifetime. If you also wish to have a similar experience, you might want to
                    go over of the best hiking trails in Pakistan the hill looks like the face of a human being lying
                    down, maybe in deep sleep if you please, making it one of the main attractions in the region.</p>

        <p>But like most art, it is not enough to just look at it. We want to feel it. We want to touch it. Whether it
            be a painting or sculpture, we want to feel every curve.
            The “<span> Le Yurt</span>” is much like a sculpture begging to be discovered further, for one to get a closer look and
            feel it, with us, because Le Yurt promises you a journey inwards to your soul.</p>
