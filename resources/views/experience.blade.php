                    <p>Stay at a luxurious yurt equipped with modern-day facilities like a 5-star suite while being
                        eco-friendly. Experience the unique and organic Bedouin Mongolian experience instead of residing
                        in a boring, non-eco-friendly, and concrete buildings that limit our interaction with nature.
