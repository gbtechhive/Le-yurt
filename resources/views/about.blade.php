                    nature at your door. Le Yurt allows you to interact with the local community, enjoy local cuisine,
                    and be involved in the therapeutic vegetable and fruit picking. Sit together in front of a bonfire
                    and enjoy the local music with a cup of hot herbal tea under the star-studded sky.</p>

                <p>Le Yurt understands the growing concerns of global warming and climate change. The concrete
                    structures in the region are a significant threat to the regionâ€™s biodiversity. We aim to mitigate
                    the exploitative nature of hotels and resorts by focusing on being eco-friendly and sustainable. The
                    use of yurts instead of concrete buildings to connect our customers with nature gives them a unique
                    and original Bedouin Mongolian experience. By partnering with the locals, we aim to contribute more
                    to the local economy and stop the leakage of resources.
