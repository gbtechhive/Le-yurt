            <p>The homes that once belonged to ancient Mongolian nomadic tribes are now being modernized and turned into
                more permanent accommodation. High wind speeds would knock over a regular square or rectangular house,
                so the yurts are made in circular shapes to prevent the wind from disturbing the body in any way
                possible. The structure consists of an angled assembly or latticework of wood or bamboo for walls, a
                door frame, ribs (poles, rafters), and a wheel (crown, compression ring), possibly steam-bent. The roof
                structure is often self-supporting, but large yurts may have interior posts supporting the dome. The top
                of the wall of self-supporting yurts is prevented from spreading by a tension band that opposes the roof
                ribs' force. Modern yurts are permanently built on a wooden platform; they may use modern materials such
                as steam-bent wooden framing or metal framing, canvas or tarpaulin, plexiglass dome, wire rope, or
                radiant insulation.</p>

        <p>Historically, yurts have scored high for energy efficiency; their round walls minimize surface areas where
            heat can’t escape. In addition to their smaller carbon and construction footprints, yurts are a better fit
            for a natural setting.</p>

            <p>There are certain beliefs and notions too that are followed when we talk about yurts. i.e., The space
                opposite the entrance is called tor. It is a seat of honor for special guests. The yurt is a gift, an
                ancient nomadic shelter only recently available to modern culture. Versatile, beautiful, and spiritual,
                both ancient and contemporary versions provide an option for shelter that is affordable, accessible, and
                gentle to the earth. By its very existence, the yurt calls forth life in simplicity, in community, and
                in harmony with the planet.</p>
            <p>The yurt's healing, creative, communal, and spiritual nature lends itself to use in the healing arts,
                retreat centers, spiritual practices such as meditation, and community gatherings. The embrace of the
                round space gives a sense of well-being and wholeness. Bringing people together in a circle fosters
                connection and equality.</p>

        <p>If you’re a person who doesn’t like being tied to one place, then a yurt gives you the freedom to live close
            to nature. Spend quality time with your friends and family at LE Yurt in a luxurious and cozy yurt and
            experience nature at your doorstep.</p>
